# Assistant
Personal assistant programed in Python. It supports both voice recognition for commands and voice feedback for reading the results.
All functionality are customized for my personal real life circumstances and not intended to be used elsewhere.
The project is currently a work in progress and so there is no documentation on anything. This will change if I decide to finalize it.


Dependencies:
Python 2.7
  gtfs-realtime-bindings
	protobuf
	SpeechRecognition
	  pyaudio
	    swig
	pygame
	gtts
